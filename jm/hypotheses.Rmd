# Files

## wikidata/wikistats (650G)

Contains hourly wikipedia article traffic statistics dataset covering 16 month 
period from October 01 2008 to February 6, 2010, from raw anonymous logs 
provided by Domas Mituzas at http://dammit.lt/2007/12/10/wikipedia-page-counters/

Each log file is named with the date and time of collection:

*pagecounts-20090430-230000.gz*

Each line has 4 fields: projectcode, pagename, pageviews, bytes

    en Barack_Obama 997 123091092
    en Barack_Obama%27s_first_100_days 8 850127
    en Barack_Obama,_Jr 1 144103
    en Barack_Obama,_Sr. 37 938821

    en Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster 5 102081


## wikidata/wikilinks (1.1G)

Contains a wikipedia linkgraph dataset provided by Henry Haselgrove.
These files contain all links between *proper english language Wikipedia pages*, 
that is pages in "namespace 0". This includes disambiguation pages and redirect 
pages.

In links-simple-sorted.txt, there is one line for each page that has links from
it. The format of the lines is:

    from1: to11 to12 to13 ...
    from2: to21 to22 to23 ...
    ...
    
where from1 is an integer labelling a page that has links from it, and 
to11 to12 to13 ... are integers labelling all the pages that the page links to. To find the page title that corresponds to integer n, just look up the n-th line in the file *titles-sorted.txt*.

## File summary:

*pagecounts-<date and time>.gz*
    -Contains n lines with 4 fields: projectcode (we want "en" only!), pagename,
                                     pageviews, and bytes
    -Dates range from 10/01/2008 to 02/06/2010
*links-simple-sorted.txt*
    -Contains all links between proper english language wikipedia pages.

*titles-sorted.txt*
    -Contains the names of all English Language Wikipedia pages.
    
# Hypotheses

## We will attempt to quantify the relationship between pages and inlinks to these pages.

   e.g. Imagine the simplest case.  A  page only has one inlink, IL. 
        Let's assume a linear model for the traffic of these three links as:
        
        $traf\;page_t = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}traf\;IL_i+\beta_{2}(bratio_{IL}_{t}*traf\;IL_i) + \epsilon_{t}$  
        
        Where $bratio_{IL}_{t}=\frac{bytes_IL_{t}}{bytes_page}$  
        
        We would be interested in the coefficients $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$. Notice that we do not account for the main effects of           the Bytes Ratio, this is because we will assume that the Bytes  does not have an effect on link traffic that is independent of 
        the inlink traffic.  
        
        Say a page has i inlinks $(2\leq i<\infty)$, then the model generalizes to:  
        
        $$
